Description
-----------

The purpose of this app is to provide a quick look-up and easy maintenance of
Chinese medicinal herb recipes. The intention is to provide herb data in a way 
that enables easy preparation of data sheets, jar labels, etc. for Chinese herb 
recipes.

The app takes its name from the Chinese deity Shen Nong (神农), which literally 
translates as 'Peasant God' (`Wiki <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shennong>`_). 
He is revered as the deity of agriculture and herbal medicine. Many herb recipes
in use today originate from ancient texts attributed to Shen Nong.
