Shen Nong (神农本草经)
======================

Description
-----------

The purpose of this app is to provide a quick look-up and easy maintenance of
Chinese medicinal herb recipes. The intention is to provide herb data in a way
that enables easy cross-references between herbs and recipes, and between
Chinese and English/Latin names, preparation of data sheets, jar labels, etc.
for Chinese herb recipes.

The app takes its name from the Chinese deity Shen Nong (神农), which literally
translates as 'Peasant God' (`Wiki <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shennong>`_).
He is revered as the deity of agriculture and herbal medicine. Many herb recipes
in use today originate from ancient texts attributed to Shen Nong.

While it may be possible to incorporate this app into other projects, it is
designed as a standalone program that uses a web browser as ui.

Requirements
------------

The initial version was developed with Django 1.8.16. I expect it will run with
later versions, but this had not been tested. There are likely to be
compatibility issues with Django < 1.7.

Development was done on Python 3.4. No attempt has been made to ensure
compatibility with other Pythons, but I have no reason to expect major issues
except with Python 2.
