Shen Nong (神农本草经)
======================

Description
-----------

The purpose of this app is to provide a quick look-up and easy maintenance of
Chinese medicinal herb recipes. The intention is to provide herb data in a way
that enables easy cross-references between herbs and recipes, and between
Chinese and English/Latin names, preparation of data sheets, jar labels, etc.
for Chinese herb recipes.

The app takes its name from the Chinese deity Shen Nong (神农), which literally
translates as 'Peasant God' (`Wiki <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shennong>`_).
He is revered as the deity of agriculture and herbal medicine. Many herb recipes
in use today originate from ancient texts attributed to Shen Nong.

While it may be possible to incorporate this app into other projects, it is
designed as a standalone program that uses a web browser as ui.

Requirements
------------

The original version was developed with Django 1.8.16. The app has since been
upgraded to run under Django 3.2.25, and should run comfortably under all
versions of Django from 2.0 to 3.x. It is no longer compatible with Django <
2.0. The recommended Django is now 3.2.25.

Development was initially done on Python 3.4. Since Python 3.4 went into EOL
the app has been shown to run happily on more modern Pythons up to 3.8 with no
modification. The recommended Python is now 3.8.
